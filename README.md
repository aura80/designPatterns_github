--- SW DESIGN PRINCIPLES ---

DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself - avoid duplicate code;

KISS - Keep It Stupid Simple - code as simple as possible;

YAGHI - You Aren't Gonna Need It - we have to delete what we do not use;

Manifesto - similar to Agile Manifesto: 
                     - well-crafted sw, over working sw;       
                     - adding value, over being responsive to changes;       
                     - community of professionals, over interactions between individuals;       
                     - partnerships, over customer collaboration;

--- SOLID PRINCIPLES ---

SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY - each class should have a single responsibility in the project;

OPEN CLOSED - classes should be open for extension but closed for modification;

LYSKOV's SUSTITUTION - any base type can be substituted by a derived one;

INTERFACE SEGREGATION - interfaces should not have too many methods;

DEPENDENCY INVERSION - high-level modules should not depend on low-level module, both should depend on abstraction (abstract classes, interfaces and parent classes);
